# Reinventing the Wheel

Welcome to Reinventing the Wheel! This repository contains code samples where I explore and learn advanced Node.js concepts by building simple implementations of common tools and functionalities.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find various code snippets and implementations of fundamental Node.js concepts and utilities. These snippets are not meant to be production-ready solutions but rather serve as educational exercises aimed at deepening my understanding of Node.js development.

## Contents

### Multipart Parser

In the `multipart-deprecated.js` and `multipart.js` files, you'll find implementations of a multipart form data parser. This parser is capable of handling multipart requests, parsing both form fields and file uploads.

### Form Data Parser

The `formData.js` file contains a simple form data parser that parses form data from POST requests with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type. It uses the `querystring` module to parse the request body.

### JSON Parser

In the `jsonParser.js` file, you'll find an implementation of a JSON data parser. This parser extracts JSON data from requests with the `application/json` content type and parses it into JavaScript objects.

### Router

The `router.js` file contains a basic implementation of a router for a HTTP server. It allows for defining routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handles incoming requests accordingly.

## Purpose

These code samples serve as a hands-on learning experience where I delve into the internals of Node.js and gain a deeper understanding of how various functionalities work under the hood. By reinventing common tools and concepts, I aim to solidify my knowledge and skills as a Node.js developer.
